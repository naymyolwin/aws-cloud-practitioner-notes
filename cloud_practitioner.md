## Foundational Services

- COMPUTE: Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- DATABASE: Relational Database Service (RDS) and DynamoDB
- STORAGE: Simple Storage Service (S3)
- NETWORKING: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- SECURITY: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Benefit

- Elasticity : the ability to adapt to workload changes (dynamic, short-term)
- Scalability : the ability to handle increase workloads by adding resources (more static, long-term)
- High Avilability : the ability to continue functioning, even if some componnents fail
- Reliability : the ablity to function consistently and correctly when expected
- Agility : the ability to rapidly develop, test, and launch applications to deliver business value.
- Global reach : the ability to get closer to your customer through a global infrasturcture
- pay-as-you-go pricing : only pay for what you use, and only when you need it
- Economies of scale : because of thier size, AWS can purchase things more cheaply than individual organization can

- right-sized infrastructure
- automation
- compliance scope
- managed services
